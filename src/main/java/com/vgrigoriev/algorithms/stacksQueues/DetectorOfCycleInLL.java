/**
 * Detect cycle in a linked list. A singly-linked data structure is a data structure
 * made up of nodes where each node has a pointer to the next node (or a pointer to null).
 * Suppose that you have a pointer to the first node of a singly-linked list data structure:
 * Determine whether a singly-linked data structure contains a cycle. You may use only two pointers
 * into the list (and no other variables). The running time of your algorithm should be linear in the number of nodes in the data structure.
 * If a singly-linked data structure contains a cycle, determine the first node that participates in the cycle.
 * you may use only a constant number of pointers into the list (and no other variables).
 * The running time of your algorithm should be linear in the number of nodes in the data structure.
 * You may not modify the structure of the linked list.
